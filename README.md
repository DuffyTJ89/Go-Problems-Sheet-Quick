# Go-Problems-Sheet-Quick
GO lang problems for Data Representation and Querying module. These are some coding problems designed to get a user used to Go.

List aviable here : https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html


## Getting Started

Go to website https://golang.org/dl/ 
>Download Go for your machine.



## Running the tests

>Write and save a file with the .go extension.


>Open cmd, Cmder or GitBash in the folder 


>Type Go run "filename" e.g Go Run test.go. 


>You can also build an executable by using the Go Build command in the same way.

## List of problems solved

>1. Kon’nichiwa, Sekai!  
Write a program that prints Hello, world! in Japanese (using Japanese characters) to the screen

>2. Current time  
Write a program that prints the current time and date to the console.

>3. FizzBuzz  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each on a new line, to the console, except for the following conditions. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number, and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

>4. Factorial digit sum  
Write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of the factorial of a number. n! means n x (n − 1) ... x 3 x 2 x 1. For example, 10! = 10 x 9 x ... x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Then find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

>5. Guessing game  
Write a guessing game where the user must guess a randomly generated number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too high or too low. At the end, the number of tries should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

>6. Largest and smallest in list  
Write a function that returns the largest and smallest elements in a list.

>7. Palindrome test  
Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same in reverse, e.g. radar.

>8. Merge list and sort  
Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list, e.g. merge([1,4,6], [2,3,5]) = [1,2,3,4,5,6].

>9. Newton’s method for square roots  
Write a function to calculate the square root of a number using Newton’s method. Newton’s method is to approximate the square root of a number x by picking a starting point z and then repeating the following operation.  

>10. Reverse string  
Write a function to reverse a string in Go.
